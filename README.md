# Decentralized-Patient-Record-Management-System
The Decentralized Patient Record Management System securely stores medical data on the blockchain, giving patients full control over who can access their records. It allows patients to grant or revoke access, while ensuring privacy and transparency through event logging of key actions.

# Decentralized Patient Record Management System

## Overview

The **Decentralized Patient Record Management System** is a blockchain-based solution that securely stores and manages patient records. Using smart contracts on Ethereum, patients retain full control over their medical data, ensuring privacy, security, and transparency. This system allows patients to grant or revoke access to their records, with all actions logged on the blockchain for accountability.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized system for managing patient medical records. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures that patients maintain control over their own data, can easily grant or revoke access to authorized parties, and guarantees that all actions related to their records are transparent and auditable. This project aims to address concerns around data privacy, security, and unauthorized access to sensitive health information.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Patient records are stored securely on the blockchain, providing tamper-proof data storage.
- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Patients have the ability to control who can view their medical data, empowering them with full ownership of their information.
- **Access Management**: Patients can authorize or revoke access for healthcare providers, family members, or other individuals.
- **Event Logging**: All key actions (record creation, access, revocation, viewing, deletion) are logged as events on the blockchain for transparency and auditing.
- **Privacy and Security**: Only authorized users can access the records, ensuring sensitive data remains private.
- **Owner and Patient Roles**: The contract owner can store records, while patients manage access to their own data.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development on Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: A decentralized platform for deploying and executing smart contracts.
- **Remix IDE**: A web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Solidity smart contract development and deployment.
